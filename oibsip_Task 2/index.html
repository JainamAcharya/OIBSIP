    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p class="bio">Subhas Chandra Bose (/ʃʊbˈhɑːs ˈtʃʌndrə ˈboʊs/ (listen) shuub-HAHSS CHUN-drə BOHSS;23 January 1897 – 18
        August 1945) was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among many
        Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,
        anti-Semitism, and military failure. The honorific Netaji (Hindi: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose
        in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in
        the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.

        Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The
        early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil
        Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine
        final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist
        movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a
        group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism. Bose became
        Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders,
        including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort
        had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for
        greater powers for himself.After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in
        protest, Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.</p>
    <h3>Ideology</h3>
    <p>Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle against
        the British. Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis on
        social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days. The fresh
        interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him. Some scholars think that Hindu
        spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought. As historian Leonard Gordon
        explains "Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set him apart from the
        slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian landscape."

        Bose first expressed his preference for "a synthesis of what modern Europe calls socialism and fascism" in a
        1930 speech in Calcutta. Bose later criticized Nehru's 1933 statement that there is "no middle road"
        between communism and fascism, describing it as "fundamentally wrong." Bose believed communism would not gain
        ground in India due to its rejection of nationalism and religion and suggested a "synthesis between communism
        and fascism" could take hold instead. In 1944, Bose similarly stated, "Our philosophy should be a synthesis
        between National Socialism and communism</p>
    <h3>Authoritarianism</h3>
    <p>Bose believed that authoritarianism could bring liberation and reconstruction of Indian society. He
        expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s; he
        thought they could be used to build an independent India.

        To a large number of Congress leaders, Bose programme shared enough similarities with Japanese fascists.
        After getting marginalized within Congress, Bose chose to embrace fascist regimes as allies against the British
        and fled India. Bose believed that India "must have a political system—State—of an authoritarian
        character," and "a strong central government with dictatorial powers for some years to come".

        Earlier, Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for India. However,
        during the war (and possibly as early as the 1930s), Bose seems to have decided that no democratic system could
        be adequate to overcome India's poverty and social inequalities, and he wrote that a socialist state similar to
        that of Soviet Russia (which he had also seen and admired) would be needed for the process of national
        re-building. Accordingly, some suggest that Bose's alliance with the Axis during the war was based on
        more than just pragmatism and that Bose was a militant nationalist, though not a Nazi nor a Fascist, for he
        supported the empowerment of women, secularism and other liberal ideas; alternatively, others consider he might
        have been using populist methods of mobilisation common to many post-colonial leaders.</p>
    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <p>His most famous quote was "Give me blood and I will give you freedom". Another famous quote was Dilli Chalo
        ("On to Delhi)!" This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them. Another slogan coined by him
        was "Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani" (Urdu for "Unity, Agreement, Sacrifice").</p>
